            1. Research Your Destination To Find The Best Photo Opportunities
          </h2>
          <p>
            Before your trip, I recommend researching the destination to find
            the most interesting photo opportunities.<br /><br />
            I always research the location I’m traveling to. I do this
            extensively and obsessively! <br /><br />
            It’s up to you how much research you do. But you should definitely
            spend a bit of time looking up some great places to take
            pictures.<br /><br />
            So, what kind of research can you do? <br /><br />First, you could
            search for photos that other people have taken at the locations
            you’re planning to visit.<br /><br />
            Search on Instagram or Google to get an idea of the kinds of photos
            people take there.

            2. Capture Your Journey To Tell The Complete Story Of Your Travels
          </h2>
          <p>
            Travel photography isn’t just about photographing the
            destination.<br /><br />
            For a more complete photographic story, capture your journey to and
            from the location you’re visiting. <br /><br />If you’re traveling
            by plane, try to get a window seat where you have a view of the wing
            or propeller.<br /><br />
            And of course, you could capture a beautiful aerial view of clouds,
            mountains, or city lights as you’re flying above.<br /><br />
            Your journey will often involve several different types of
            transport. And they all offer great photo opportunities.<br /><br />
            Whether you’re traveling by car, taxi, bus, train, boat, or plane,
            try to capture some interesting photos.
